<summary><b>Why Luminos is Now Free</b></summary>
I used to charge $1.99 for this tool. Then I realized I was part of the problem I complain about.

Every paywall, no matter how small, creates two groups: those who can access opportunity and those who can’t. I’ve watched talented developers held back not by lack of skill, but by lack of resources. I’ve been there myself; passed over by higher-ups who promised the world and delivered nothing but broken trust.

The system is rigged. Corporate promises are hollow. The same people who preach “meritocracy” make sure the merit is locked behind paywalls they control.

So I’m doing what I can with what I have. Maybe it’s just a small dev tool. Maybe it won’t change the world. But if it helps even one person build something amazing, create something meaningful, or just get one step closer to their goals without having to choose between rent and software, then it’s worth it.

Everyone deserves equal opportunity to succeed. Not equal outcomes - equal opportunity. That starts with removing barriers, not adding them.

This is my small rebellion against a system that profits from artificial scarcity. Use it, improve it, share it. #CodeBLACKBEARD
